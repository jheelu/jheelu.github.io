                Hi Jheeluuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu! <br>
                I know I'm a little late for all this, but it took me alot of time :( <br>
                All I wanna say is that you are the bestest and closest friend I could ever have, part of my family I believe. <br>
                Wish you all the luck in your life and I hope you get everything you want. <br>
                Hope succed in everything you do and and get fucking rich. <br>
                You're litreally the person who I can "Owns my Gallery" almost ONE THOUSAND photos xD <br>
                I've known you for the longest time of all and istg couldn't have asked for a friend,<br> like you're litreally the only person who 
                stck around me for so long. I love you so much and I hope you have a great day. Hope we stay together forever and ever. I don't care what happend , I ain't leaving you ever. <br>
                I know we fight alot, like a-lot lot, but ig it's because we care? idk :/ <br>
                I know what I said might've affected you, but It was mentally corrupting me,  
                I used to compare each and everyone w you, like everyone, and honestly ik it was wrong, 
                but heart does what it does. <br>
                I'm sorry for everything I did, I'm sorry for everything I said, I'm sorry for everything I ever did to you. 
                I know it might be end, but confronting this was the only way I could get over it. Idk what might happen next,
                 but just know that I'll always be by your side. XOXO <br>
                 It's been 2340 days. It's been 56160 Minutes. It's been 3369600 Seconds. And all those were wonderful and
                 and won't deny, but would sure want more<br>
